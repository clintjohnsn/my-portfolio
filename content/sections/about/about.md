> “_If you aren’t sure which way to do something, do it both ways and see which works better.”_ - John Carmack

I'm an experienced software engineer based out of Manchester, UK. I have extensive experience implementing regulatory-driven solutions in Banking and FinTech, including card payments, transfers, onboarding, KYC, and core banking integrations. I am passionate about all things AI🧠 and software design🧑‍💻. I love throwing myself into new environments and challenging myself to learn, adapt and grow🪴. Ownership is key for me, and I thrive in cross-functional global team environments, having worked in collaboration with product, design, engineering, devOps, and QA teams.

Currently, I'm pursuing a Masters degree🎓 in Artificial Intelligence at the University of Manchester. My secret mission? To create mind-blowing AI applications that'll make you question reality (in a good way, I promise!).

When I'm not squashing bugs or training neural networks, you'll find me:

- 🎨 Doodling illustrations and sketches (checkout my instagram!)
- 🌍 Globetrotting to collect inspiration (and maybe a few souvenirs)
- 🐉 Crafting epic D&D campaigns as the Dungeon Master extraordinaire

So, whether you're looking for a tech wizard to build your next game-changing app or just want to geek out about the latest AI tech, I'm your guy. Let's get in touch!
