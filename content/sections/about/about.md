I am a software engineer with a specializing in architecting and delivering robust, secure, and observable microservice-based cloud-native solutions. I am passionate about building things that make a difference. Collaboration is key for me, and I thrive in cross-functional team environments, working closely with other developers and stakeholders to deliver high-quality software solutions.

Currently, I'm leveling up my skills at the University of Manchester, pursuing an MSc in Artificial Intelligence. My secret mission? To create mind-blowing AI products that'll make you question reality (in a good way, I promise!).

When I'm not battling bugs or training neural networks, you'll find me:

- 🎨 Doodling my way through life's adventures
- 🌍 Globetrotting to collect inspiration (and maybe a few souvenirs)
- 🐉 Crafting epic D&D campaigns as the Dungeon Master extraordinaire

So, whether you're looking for a tech wizard to build your next game-changing app or just want to geek out about the latest AI breakthroughs, I'm your guy. Let's connect!
